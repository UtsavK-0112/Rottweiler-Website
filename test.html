            <li>Obedience school <br> Sending your dog to obedience school is a great way to help your dog learn disipline, and also a great way to improve your dog's social life.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Asserting dominence <br> Taking a piss on your dog is a great way to assert dominance and show them who's boss!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Leave it to us! <br> When the previous steps are not enough, you can count on us to get the job done! When you bring your dog to us at Peta, we will make sure that your dog will never show any aggressive behaviours again. Or any other behaviours for that matter.</li>
